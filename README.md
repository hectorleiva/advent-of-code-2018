# Advent Coding Challenge 2018

These are scripts/code intended to solve the challenges that are being given as part of Advent of Code 2018 challenge located here: https://adventofcode.com/2018

Definitely not anywhere near production code whatsoever. Just scripts to try and solve the days challenges.

Each of these days will have their own directory for the day of the challenge with any number of different scripts/code intended to solve that particular challenge.
